+ convert inbuf to look like a pent (maybe put it _in_ a pent?)
+ move vars to dict
+ hex number input
+ init uart before reading/writing
+ get a char from uart
+ read value from timer
+ loop (while)
+ loop (until)
+ if / ifelse
+ improve get char to wait for available
+ improve put char to wait for ready
+ write to OK LED
+ sleep for specified time
+ flash a sequence on LED
+ read commands from UART on boot
+ words to dump dict, pool etc.

Later
-----
+ split "rom" and "ram"
+ creation of arbitrary data in pent
+ lookup data from key (char)
+ build a morse flasher
+ read from mailbox
+ write to mailbox
+ get board revision
+ setup GPIO pins
+ read/write GPIO pins
+ read/write 12c
+ read/write spi

Maybe
-----
+ variable length dent
