E13 - a bare-metal programming language for Raspberry Pi
--------------------------------------------------------

E13 is the latest (2013) attempt at an implementation of ELIUS (Extendible Language Interpreter Using Stacks) - 
this time aimed as a system language for software development on the Raspberry Pi development board. The plan is to implement a
bare minimum of a language features necessary to build the CORNELIUS operating system and run interesting or useful software on top of it. 
In this scenario, ELIUS forms the language part of CORNELIUS, while CORN (Communication-Oriented Runtime Nucleus) describes the
implementation of the operating system layer.

ELIUS is a language inspired by the work of Charles "Chuck" Moore. In particular, several of the key concepts and approaches are based on
ideas from his "unpublished" book "Programming a Problem-Oriented Language" ( http://colorforth.com/POL.htm )

Development of this system is being haphazardly documented at http://raspberryalphaomega.org.uk/
